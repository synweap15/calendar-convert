Title: Show HN: Ad‑hoc availability app – timezone‑aware weekly overlap (no login)

Body:

I built a small, MIT-licensed app to end ad‑hoc "when are you free?" timezone discussions for cross-TZ teams. Heavy scheduling tools already exist, but for quick overlap checks they’re overkill.

This app shows a 7×48 weekly grid (30‑minute slots). You click to select availability, then share a single URL. The viewer sees your ranges in their own timezone, and the app keeps a "sender timezone" badge for context.

Highlights:

- Ad‑hoc, zero‑signup flow (state in URL)
- Timezone‑aware display (detected vs. sender)
- Half‑hour slots, overlap checks, range preview + delete
- DST‑safe (Intl‑based) without external date libs
- MIT licensed

Would love feedback on UX, DST edge cases, and additional niceties for one‑off coordination.

Title: Free app for ad‑hoc availability – quick overlap across timezones (MIT)

Body:

I open‑sourced a tiny app to solve a common pain: ad‑hoc “when are you free?” across timezones. Full scheduling suites handle this at scale, but when you just need a quick overlap, this keeps friction low.
How it works:

- Pick half‑hour slots in a weekly grid
- Share a single URL - no login, no backend
- Viewers see times in their own timezone, with a "sender timezone" badge
- Compact, URL‑safe state; DST‑safe using Intl
